> Elon just can’t stand when a competitor is executing and it doesn’t have to do with him. This entire frivolous claim is just an extension of his “0% chance of success” dig when he left OpenAI. The fact that we don’t care about his trade secrets doesn’t register. Other companies talking to people who don’t want to work at xAI anymore must once again be all about him.
> 
> In a sense, I guess it was, just not in the way the dismissed complaint assumed.
> 
> Most of them left him anyway.
> 
> OpenAI Newsroom: We welcome the Court's decision. This baseless lawsuit was never anything more than yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.
