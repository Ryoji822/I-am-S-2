> RT Alexander Embiricos
> What we've improved re requests being routed from GPT-5.3-Codex to GPT-5.2:
> - We significantly reduced the number of requests and users flagged as elevated risk by calibrating our classifiers and policies. (This is what caused rerouting.) As we calibrate policies I predict this will be well under 1% of users.
> - We shipped loud, per-turn notifications in product for when requests are downgraded to the CLI v0.102.0. They are coming to other clients asap.
> - We resolved cases where users who verified via Trusted Access did not regain access to GPT-5.3-Codex.
> - We added docs to explain this all at https://developers.openai.com/codex/concepts/cyber-safety.
> 
> Appreciate your patience these past couple days as the team worked on all of this. More improvements to come.
> 
> Alexander Embiricos: Update: Between 15:35 and 18:45 PT today, we were overflagging for potentially suspicious activity. We estimate 9% of users were impacted.
> We fixed the issue at 18:45 PT and are working to prevent this overflagging going forward.

> Extremely grateful to work with Josh. No one could ask for a more committed, more thoughtful, or harder-working investor.
> 
> Joshua Kushner: We are pleased to announce the close of Thrive X. Exceeding $10 billion, Thrive X comprises $1 billion designated for early-stage investments and $9 billion designated for growth-stage investments. We do not view this as a milestone, but as a commitment to the long work ahead.

> If you’re an infrastructure or security engineer, now is the best time to join OpenAI.
> 
> It’s hard not to be inspired by what today’s coding tools are capable of, and we have line of sight to making them much better. While our core ML infrastructure problems remain much the same as always — training and inferencing models at scale, co-designing end-to-end for maximum effect, managing complexity and maintaining fast iteration — what it feels like to solve these problems in practice is changing fast.
> 
> As the models have been improving, our ability to get value out of them is increasingly bottlenecked by thoughtfully designed infrastructure — whether figuring out how to manage agent cross-collaboration, having ergonomic sandboxes that let the agents complete end-to-end workflows securely, building tools/abstractions/observability/frameworks which allow the agents to move faster, and scaling supervision of the agents' work.
> 
> Engineering is already different from a few months ago, and will continue to evolve. Having seen many generations of engineering and AI tools, I believe what is most important going forward will be skills like the following: strong understanding of your domain, ability to think through abstraction/architecture/design/how the pieces should fit together, and deep curiosity to explore what these models have to offer.
