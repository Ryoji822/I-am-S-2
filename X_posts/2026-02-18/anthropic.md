> Fun nugget from Sonnet 4.6: With a 1M context window, the model is better at long-horizon planning. 
> 
> In the Vending-Bench Arena, models compete to run a simulated business. Sonnet 4.6 developed a new strategy: invest heavily in capacity for the first 10 months, then pivot hard to profitability. It finished well ahead of the competition.
> 
> A 1M token context window is enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request.
