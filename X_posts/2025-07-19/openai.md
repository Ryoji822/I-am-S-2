> 🏅medal performance at IMO using purely natural language reasoning, no tools or internet! was expecting this to take a few more years but the team has made such rapid progress, congrats @alexwei_ @SherylHsu02 @polynoamial and many others at @OpenAI on this amazing achievement!!

> RT Noam Brown
> Today, we at @OpenAI achieved a milestone that many considered years away: gold medal-level performance on the 2025 IMO with a general reasoning LLM—under the same time limits as humans, without tools. As remarkable as that sounds, it’s even more significant than the headline 🧵
