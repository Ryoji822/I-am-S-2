> AI doesn't just accelerate science in big ways, it accelerates it in a thousand incremental compounding ways too.

> Derya Unutmaz, MD: I've now created, using the OpenAI Codex app, a massive Cancer Mutation Catalog of driver mutations! It contains more than 90,000 mutations across 1,600 genes. You can filter by cancer type, limited now, but will soon expand it to include all cancer types

> RT Sam Altman
> First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.
> 
> But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.
> 
> I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.
> 
> More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)
> 
> Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.
> 
> Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.

> RT Kate Rouch 🛡️
> Betrayal! Deception! Treachery!
> 
> Those ads are funny 
> 
> (and the former meta ads executive who made them is good at his job. he had a lot of practice)
> 
> Here’s what’s not funny:
> 
> Calling “ads” a betrayal when your business model is selling paid subscriptions to companies.
> 
> ChatGPT has more free users in Texas than Claude (trademark) has globally.
> 
> Real betrayal isn’t ads. It’s control.
> 
> Anthropic thinks powerful AI should be tightly controlled in small rooms in San Francisco and Davos. 
> 
> That its too DANGEROUS for you.
> 
> That the future should be built somewhere else, by someone who is smarter
> 
> We don’t believe that.
> 
> Every week, 300M+ people use ChatGPT to learn how to do something.
> 
> More than half of U.S. users say it helped them do something they once thought was impossible.
> 
> Free access creates agency.
> 
> When people have the tools, THEY decide what to build.
> 
> You can just build things.

> It's fun watching Doug try to contain his exasperation with the bots' "logic" and actions in the replays. Clearly we still have a long way to go until LLMs master poker.
> 
> Happy to see GPT-5.2 is the champion though!
> 
> Doug Polk (Code Doug): The results are in. 900,000 hands later, we have a winner in the AI Poker Showdown from @kaggle 
> 
> I don't want to spoil the results here, but we had an awesome match in the finals between o3 and GPT 5.2
> 
> Watch the video to see who wins: https://youtu.be/3yy_sPRDDt0
