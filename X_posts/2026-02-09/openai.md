> I remember when I was 8, my dad got me a Commodore 64 for my birthday. All of the other gifts are fuzzy in memory, but that one stands out, because it had such ripple effects throughout the rest of my life.
> 
> Sure, it was mostly about video games at first. It came with a few, but my parents weren’t keen on spending more on off-the-shelf stuff. I also started to wonder how these games worked. So I moved on to collecting programming magazines and checking out books from the library that contained machine language instructions for coding up various make-your-own-games. I started by just punching in the code in a rote manner, but realizing that you could write stuff into the instruction sets of these machines and that they would then do things felt like magic. It led me to want to learn languages, from BASIC to Pascal to eventually C.
> 
> Later on in my teens, I picked up a modem, and stumbled upon the old BBS’s of the pre-internet era and university Gopher networks. Realizing that you could use these tools as another way to talk to people and belong to a community felt like another unlock.
> 
> No one sat me down and said I should do these things. The simple fact that I could, revealed by a gift given by a loved one on a whim, set in motion an ongoing curiosity with tech and computing that now spans decades. I would guess that for a lot of people who love coding, building things, engineering, design and tech, similar moments stand out in their lives.

> RT Cory House
> tldr: If you haven’t used Codex lately, try again with the new 5.3 model. It responds faster, one shots more, and often provides better results than Opus.
> 
> 5.3 is the first time I’m considering switching from Claude Code to Codex as my primary.
> 
> Theo - t3.gg: I've been using 5.3 Codex for 3 weeks. It's an incredible model. I've built so much stuff with it.
> 
> Made a vid showing everything I love about it, as well as a few call-outs of things I hope OpenAI changes.
