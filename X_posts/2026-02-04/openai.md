> Just because we focus on research doesn't mean we will pursue *all* research. Jakub and I have our own research tastes as well (I think we're fairly good tastemakers 😅), and we have to importance weight the various paths to AGI.
> 
> 🍓🍓🍓: @markchen90 @merettm sorry to ask. can you speak to why former employees state there reason for leaving as being unable to do research. 
> 
> there’s a lot of speculation you could directly address.

> That characterization is simply wrong. Foundational research has been core to OpenAI from the start, and today we run a research program with hundreds of exploratory projects - much like the ones that led to our reasoning-model breakthrough. The majority of our compute is allocated to foundational research and exploration - and not product milestones.
> 
> Anyone who has spent time with me or Jakub knows we are the last people in the world who would push for the advancement of products over the advancement of research. We’re in the business of creating an automated scientist, and capabilities that were considered grand challenges just a few years ago (like IMO-level mathematical reasoning) now emerge as normal parts of the research process. We’re also seeing our models accelerate researchers worldwide, helping advance work across biology, mathematics, physics, and even our own research.
> 
> Jakub and I put a lot of effort into ensuring that research stays focused on uncovering algorithms that will scale to the compute we’ll have a year from now. We protect mindshare and amplify discourse on exploratory work. We do this while recognizing that we’re also a deployment company - and that deployment gives us access to even larger-scale comp...(truncated)
