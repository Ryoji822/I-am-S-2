> The secret behind Gemini 3?
> 
> Simple: Improving pre-training & post-training 🤯
> 
> Pre-training: Contra the popular belief that scaling is over—which we discussed in our NeurIPS '25 talk with @ilyasut and @quocleix—the team delivered a drastic jump. The delta between 2.5 and 3.0 is as big as we've ever seen. No walls in sight!
> 
> Post-training: Still a total greenfield. There's lots of room for algorithmic progress and improvement, and 3.0 hasn't been an exception, thanks to our stellar team.
> 
> Congratulations to the whole team 💙💙💙
