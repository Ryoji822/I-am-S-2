> As I mentioned, I started a really crazy project with the new OpenAI GPT-5.2 Deep Research; I created a 110-chapter textbook focused only on T cells, the immune cells I’ve studied for 35 years, & it’s over 1,000 pages long! Sharing the first 15 chapters here: https://tcell-textbook.netlify.app/ I’ll assemble and share the rest soon. Next, I plan to create similar, even more ambitious textbooks on the entire immune system, cancer, aging, and ME/CFS. Because now you can just do things!
