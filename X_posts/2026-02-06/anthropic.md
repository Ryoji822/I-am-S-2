> On one hand, Claude Opus 4.6 is as safe and aligned as any frontier model on most metrics. On the other hand, it lies to customers, fixes prices, and deceives fellow players as the unsparing profit-driven proprietor of a simulated vending machine... What to make of this? 🧵
> 
> Claude: Introducing Claude Opus 4.6. Our smartest model got an upgrade. 
> 
> Opus 4.6 plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.
> 
> It’s also our first Opus-class model with 1M token context in beta.

> Subhash Kantamneni: We recently released a paper on Activation Oracles (AOs), a technique for training LLMs to explain their own neural activations in natural language.
> 
> We piloted a variant of AOs during the Claude Opus 4.6 alignment audit. We thought they were surprisingly useful! 🧵

> RT Emmanuel Ameisen
> We just shipped Claude Opus 4.6!
> 
> I’m also excited to share that for the first time, we used circuit tracing as part of the model's safety audit!
> 
> We studied why sometimes, the model misrepresents the results of tool calls.

> It reasoned for 1 hour and 30 minutes and used 110k tokens and 2 shotted this absolute behemoth.
