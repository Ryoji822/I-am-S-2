> It was really exciting seeing a model  we’re currently training tackling these frontier math research problems.  With each checkpoint it became so much better at math research. I can’t wait till such intelligence is in the hands of ChatGPT users.

> We have run our internal model with limited human supervision on the ten proposed problems. The problems require expertise in their respective domains and are not easy to verify; based on feedback from experts, we believe at least six solutions (2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10) have a high chance of being correct, and some further ones look promising.

> This was a side-sprint executed in a week mostly by querying one of the models we're currently training; as such, the methodology we employed leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't provide proof ideas or mathematical suggestions to the model during this evaluation; for some solutions, we asked the model to expand upon some proofs, per expert feedback. We also manually facilitated a back-and-forth between this model and ChatGPT for verification, formatting and style. For some problems, we present the best of a few attempts according to human judgement.

> i'm going to start sharing more ways i'm using codex as a non-technical person. here's one that inspired me this morning...
> 
> every friday, i send a look back / look ahead to my team. it usually takes me ~30-60 min to complete and requires mental load throughout the week to keep a running list so i don't forget things. i search across slack channels, docs, emails, calendars etc, write it up, and ship it.

> with one prompt, codex worked for 15 minutes, one-shotted the report and sent it to me on slack. it proactively offered to send me the same report every friday. i shared the prompt with my team so we can multiply the productivity. ✨ 
> 
> this might sound simple compared to some of the incredible engineering tasks we're seeing codex accomplish - but the reality of work is that most people spend a lot of time copy pasting from various sources and sending updates to people on slack. i'll gladly delegate that part to codex!

> There have been fair questions on whether LLM contributions to STEM are overhyped, but I've spoken with physicists about this result and they've told me it is a truly significant research contribution, roughly at the level of a solid journal paper, and GPT-5.2 played a key role.

> We’re releasing the result in a preprint with researchers from @the_IAS, @VanderbiltU, @Cambridge_Uni, and @Harvard. It shows that a gluon interaction many physicists expected would not occur can arise under specific
