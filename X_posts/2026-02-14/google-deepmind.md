> Gave Gemini 3 Deep Think an image of a 3D spider web and asked for an interactive design tool. It generated a full design suite (procedural control, simulation, optimization) with STL export capability. I used it to engineer new metamaterials and a spider-web inspired bridge design, 3D printed it, then validated the structural integrity with a @nvidia DGX Spark load test.  A mind-blowing example of the future of material and architecture design - image in, fabrication-ready design out! @GeminiApp
