> I was working on a particular task: finding a case-free proof of the representability of the local Néron function correction using a combination of multiplicative-case–related correction terms. It's an extremely tedious, case-dependent, and rather repulsive type of proof.
> 
> So, I provided the input from my paper and asked GPT Pro whether it could suggest a case-free proof. After about 15 minutes, I received a beautiful, conceptual explanation that invoked the full power of the degenerate fibre's dual graph-along with the astonishing suggestion that a slightly normalized version of the local error correction is actually an energy functional. I was shocked. I had never expected such profound insight.

> In hindsight, I can now see what I had missed. But I did miss it-and the model guided me all the way to the proof. This new proof is far more elegant than the previous one. I had only a vague vision, a guess that such an approach might work, but the model's combination of deep literature awareness and the combinatorial power of its tree-search strategies led me directly to the conceptual core of the proof.
