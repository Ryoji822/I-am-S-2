> RT Anthropic
> Since release, Petri, our open-source tool for automated alignment audits, has been adopted by research groups and trialed by other AI developers.
> 
> We're now releasing Petri 2.0, with improvements to counter eval-awareness and expanded seeds covering a wider range of behaviors.
> 
> Anthropic: It’s called Petri: Parallel Exploration Tool for Risky Interactions. It uses automated agents to audit models across diverse scenarios.
> 
> Describe a scenario, and Petri handles the environment simulation, conversations, and analyses in minutes.

> 🧫Petri 2 is probably the best tool out there for getting a clear quantitative and qualitative picture of the alignment traits of some new model.
> 
> It works well out of the box, and even better if you spend an couple of hours brainstorming your own metrics and scenario ideas.
> 
> Kai Fronsdal: Capable models increasingly recognize when they’re being evaluated, which can undermine our ability to measure their alignment. We’re releasing Petri 2.0 with mitigations for this, plus 70 new seed instructions and updated frontier model benchmarks.
