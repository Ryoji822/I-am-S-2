> Behind the scenes fun getting ready for #MadebyGoogle with @jimmyfallon. At our first MBG in 2016, I said that innovation lies at the intersection of hardware, software, and AI. Almost 10 generations later, we're excited to show you how AI continues to transform our Pixel family of products to help you in your everyday life.
