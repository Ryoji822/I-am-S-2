> Yesterday we reached an agreement with the Department of War for deploying advanced AI systems in classified environments, which we requested they make available to all AI companies.
> 
> We think our deployment has more guardrails than any previous agreement for classified AI deployments, including Anthropic's. Here's why: https://openai.com/index/our-agreement-with-the-department-of-war/

> Please read this blog post. Our red lines are clear and we will protect them. Unlike other agreements, we are not working through Palantir, we are responsible for our own models and our own safety. We will have our people in place to guarantee that responsible & safe deployment.

> RT Tibo
> Personal view. On the DoW deal, time and time again I witness how OpenAI operates thoughtfully and diplomatically when it comes to raising the bar on safety. I also believe that figuring out how to deploy powerful new technology in the pursuit of national security (not just the USA) is important.
> 
> The company deeply understands what it can and cannot reasonably have control over and focuses instead of setting the right guardrails to ensure that deployment is aligned with what is considered acceptable and safe.
> 
> I am proud of the level of transparency provided in the blog post, and hope that other companies, including Anthropic, were as transparent on prior and future deals they make.
