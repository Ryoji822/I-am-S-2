> Stephen Curry 🤝 Google. 
> 
> As an avid Warriors fan, thrilled to welcome @StephenCurry30 as Google’s new Performance Advisor! Stephen is bringing his expertise to help us build products for everyone - and also find unique ways that he can use them to improve his game. 🏀
> 
> For example, Stephen is using Pixel to sharpen his workout strategy and continue to develop as an incredible player. He’s also using AI insights from Google Cloud to help analyze his shot quality (not that he needs much help there!). Excited for the future of this partnership!
