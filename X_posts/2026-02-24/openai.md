> The standard for frontier coding evals is changing with model maturity.
> 
> We now recommend reporting SWE-bench Pro and are sharing more detail on why we’re no longer reporting SWE-bench Verified as we work with the industry to establish stronger coding eval standards.
> 
> SWE-bench Verified was a strong benchmark, but we’ve found evidence it is now saturated due to test-design issues and contamination from public repositories.

> Stargate is the umbrella brand for our compute strategy. It’s about mobilizing the full ecosystem to deliver a step-change in global AI compute — and over the past few quarters that vision has become reality.
> 
> Since announcing Stargate in January 2025, OpenAI has expanded from a mostly single-provider model to a broad partner network across clouds, silicon, and infrastructure: SoftBank, NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom, Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, CoreWeave, and Cerebras.
> 
> Demand is compounding, and no single provider, chip, or cloud can carry the load. A diversified compute model is the only way to scale at the pace AI requires.
> 
> We exited 2025 with ~2 GW of available compute and a model designed to scale: long-term capacity agreements, purpose-built colo deployments, and deep collaboration on next-generation datacenter design.
> 
> Compute leadership is the foundation of research and product velocity — and Stargate is how we build what comes next.
