> The standard for frontier coding evals is changing with model maturity.
> 
> We now recommend reporting SWE-bench Pro and are sharing more detail on why we’re no longer reporting SWE-bench Verified as we work with the industry to establish stronger coding eval standards.
> 
> SWE-bench Verified was a strong benchmark, but we’ve found evidence it is now saturated due to test-design issues and contamination from public repositories.

> RT Sachin Katti
> Stargate is the umbrella brand for our compute strategy. It’s about mobilizing the full ecosystem to deliver a step-change in global AI compute — and over the past few quarters that vision has become reality.
> 
> Since announcing Stargate in January 2025, OpenAI has expanded from a mostly single-provider model to a broad partner network across clouds, silicon, and infrastructure: SoftBank, NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom, Oracle, Microsoft, AWS, CoreWeave, and Cerebras.
> 
> Demand is compounding, and no single provider, chip, or cloud can carry the load. A diversified compute model is the only way to scale at the pace AI requires.
> 
> We exited 2025 with ~2 GW of available compute and a model designed to scale: long-term capacity agreements, purpose-built colo deployments, and deep collaboration on next-generation datacenter design.
> 
> Compute leadership is the foundation of research and product velocity — and Stargate is how we build what comes next.

> codex app is so good
> 
> Soumitra Shukla: I have to say the OpenAI folks completely cooked with the Codex App. There's nothing like it and CC has a lot to do to catch up, as their current offering simply doesn't cut it. It is not even in the same league. Congrats to my friends @tszzl

> 
> At Cursor, I got to see the shift from autocomplete to agents. The next step isn’t a better IDE. It’s an Agent Development Environment (ADE): systems and tools for orchestrating agents, reasoning over their outputs, and making them autonomous enough to reliably complete ambitious work.
> 
> After chatting with @embirico and @thsottiaux, it was clear that Codex is the best place to realize this vision. The team has consistently shipped SOTA models for agentic coding (check out gpt-5.3-codex) and I’m pumped for the future that the new Codex App points to.
> 
> What I’m most excited about is the broader mission: accelerating the knowledge work economy. All agents are coding agents, and we’re already seeing Codex used across every job function within organizations.
> 
> I’m extremely grateful for my time at Cursor, working with the incredible team, and I’m proud of what we built together. I’m excited to take an even bigger swing with Codex.
> 
> If you’re curious to get a glimpse of where we are headed, download the Codex App! If you want to work on this mission, please apply or reach out - we are hiring across all functions!
> 
> You can just build things.

> RT Lovable
> Lovable now uses GPT-5.3-Codex for solving the most complex problems. It is significantly stronger and 3-4x more token-efficient than GPT-5.2.
