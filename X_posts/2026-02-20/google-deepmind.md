> Google is once again the leader in AI: Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview leads the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, 4 points ahead of Claude Opus 4.6 while costing less than half as much to run
> 
> @GoogleDeepMind gave us pre-release access to Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview. It leads 6 of the 10 evaluations that make up the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index and improves significantly over Gemini 3 Pro Preview across capabilities, with the biggest gains in reasoning and knowledge, coding, and hallucination reduction.
> 
> Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview also remains relatively token efficient, using ~57M tokens to run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (+1M from Gemini 3 Pro Preview), lower than other frontier models at max reasoning settings such as Opus 4.6 (max) and GPT-5.2 (xhigh). Combined with lower per-token pricing, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview is cost-efficient among frontier peers, costing less than half as much as Opus 4.6 (max) to run the full Intelligence Index, though still nearly 2x the leading open-weights model, GLM-5.
