> Pairing this with usage per user growing significantly faster than the number of users, it's pretty clear that compute will be something that is scarce.

> Since yesterday, I have been working with my collaborator Piotr Pokora on a problem related to log surfaces. We were trying to figure out how to search the combinatorial space of possible configurations of lines on a smooth quartic in order to maximize the so-called Chern slope. In terms of numerics, we have done many examples, and the famous Fermat quartic x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0 is currently the record holder for the slope (= 8/3) for a particular configuration of 16 lines (see our paper). This was the expected maximum, which we have been trying to beat or prove for the last two years. Today I ran the problem with the top version of GPT Pro using a hefty prompt that included many details about the problem and the full text of our paper.

> I now realize that there are three of us in the office: two humans and one agentic system with skills and substantial computational power. Skills are becoming increasingly important, and this agentic harness produces amazing results. I feel that I have completely shifted my perspective. I still like collaborating with humans, but I delegate deep searches, bold ideation, and extensive exploration to the models. It is simply faster and more efficient....(truncated)
