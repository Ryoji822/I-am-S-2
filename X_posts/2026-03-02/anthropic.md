> RT Ben Springwater
> I finally put my finger on why I have felt so put off by OpenAI’s recent moves with the DoW. 
> 
> Consider the counter-factual if OAI had stood shoulder to shoulder with Anthropic — not by demanding the same carve-outs (it’s defensible for OAI to accede to “any lawful use”) but rather by demanding that DoW drop the supply chain threat.
> 
> What a powerful, hopeful moment of solidarity that would have been. A precedent for cooperation. A salvo against Moloch. But instead OAI seems content to let Anthropic get wiped off the board,* despite lip service to the contrary.
> 
> Take the outside view. Are our prospects for a good AI future better or worse with a competitive industry that includes Anthropic? Or are we better off with more extreme concentration of power?
> 
> The irony is OAI was founded precisely to safeguard against concentration of power.
> 
> I get it, the market is red in tooth and claw and all that. This is the way of the world and it is normally for the best.
> 
> But if you consider AI an exceptional technology, as industry participants do, it would seem both rational and good to fight back against the capricious, unjustified “corporate murder” of a key good actor — even if their strength is inconvenient to your IPO.
> 
> I’m not advocating charity. I’m just saying, some principles are bigger than game of thrones, or they should be.
> 
> *to be clear I don’t think this will happen, but it is the current stated intention of the federal government
