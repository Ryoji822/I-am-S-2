> Folks often point to @fchollet as an AGI skeptic, but he's said multiple times that he thinks it arrives within 5 years.
> 
> The AI we have today is not AGI, but it's progressing very quickly.

> François Chollet: @Yossi_Dahan_ @polynoamial ARC-4 is in the works, to be released early 2027. ARC-5 is also planned. The final ARC will probably be 6-7. The point is to keep making benchmarks until it is no longer possible to propose something that humans can do and AI can't. AGI ~2030.
